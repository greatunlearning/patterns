# The Great Unlearning Pattern Library

## Overview

This library documents emerging patterns for LLM-assisted software development. These patterns represent new approaches to software design and development that optimize for collaboration between humans and AI language models.

> **üß™ Experimental Notice**: These patterns are emerging from practical experience and community observations. They are not fixed rules but rather evolving guidelines that may change as LLM capabilities and tools evolve.

## Core Concepts

Before diving into specific patterns, it's important to understand the key principles that drive this new approach:

1. **Context Over Reuse**: Prioritize clear, self-contained context over traditional DRY principles
2. **Natural Language First**: Design for conversation with AI assistants
3. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Make intentions and dependencies clear
4. **Self-Containment**: Each component should include everything needed to understand and recreate it

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Architectural Patterns

#### Prompt-Oriented Architecture (POA)
**Context**: Traditional architectures organize code around technical concepts, which can be difficult to modify through natural language interaction.

**Solution**: Structure applications around natural language descriptions and common prompt patterns.

```
feature/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intent.md         # Purpose and requirements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/   # Actual code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/           # Self-contained tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/         # Common modification scenarios
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier LLM understanding and modification
- Clear documentation integrated with code
- Natural alignment with human-AI collaboration

#### Context Window Optimization (CWO)
**Context**: LLMs have limited context windows, making it difficult to understand code spread across many files.

**Solution**: Organize code to fit within typical LLM context windows.

```
feature/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies.md           # Explicit dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-logic/              # Fits in one context window
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extensions/              # Each fits in one window
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration-points.md    # Connection documentation
```

**Benefits**:
- Better LLM comprehension
- Faster, more accurate modifications
- Clearer component boundaries

### 2. Implementation Patterns

#### Self-Regenerating Modules (SRM)
**Context**: Code often needs to be regenerated or heavily modified by LLMs.

**Solution**: Design modules to include all context needed for regeneration.

**Key Elements**:
- Complete business context
- Clear contracts and dependencies
- Self-contained validation rules
- Explicit boundaries

#### Context-First Design (CFD)
**Context**: Traditional DRY principles can make code harder for LLMs to understand holistically.

**Solution**: Prioritize complete context over code reuse.

**Implementation**:
```
feature/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md       # Complete business context
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/  # Self-contained code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Context-specific tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies/   # Explicit dependencies
```

### 3. Documentation Patterns

#### LLM-Friendly Documentation Pattern (LFDP)
**Context**: Traditional documentation focuses on human readers and often lacks context needed by LLMs.

**Solution**: Create documentation that serves both human and AI readers.

**Components**:
- Natural language descriptions
- Code examples
- Common modification scenarios
- Test cases
- Integration points

#### Conversational Interface Pattern (CIP)
**Context**: Code modifications often happen through natural language interaction.

**Solution**: Design components to be modified through conversation.

**Features**:
- Clear modification boundaries
- Natural language validation rules
- Self-contained business logic

### 4. Process Patterns

#### AI-Assisted Versioning
**Context**: Traditional commit messages and change documentation don't provide enough context for LLMs.

**Solution**: Structure version control for AI comprehension.

**Implementation**:
- Detailed commit messages with clear context
- Change documentation in natural language
- Impact descriptions for each change

#### Prompt-Driven Testing (PDT)
**Context**: Traditional test cases can be difficult for LLMs to understand and modify.

**Solution**: Design tests to be AI-generateable and modifiable.

**Characteristics**:
- Natural language scenarios
- Self-contained test contexts
- Clear test boundaries
- AI-friendly assertions

## Pattern Evolution

### Contributing New Patterns

1. Create an issue describing the pattern
2. Include:
   - Context where it's useful
   - Problem it solves
   - Implementation examples
   - Benefits and tradeoffs

### Pattern Lifecycle

Patterns go through these stages:
1. **Emerging**: Initial observation and documentation
2. **Experimental**: Being tested in real projects
3. **Established**: Proven useful in multiple contexts
4. **Evolving**: Being modified based on new tools/capabilities
5. **Deprecated**: No longer relevant due to tool evolution

## Anti-Patterns

### Over-Abstraction
‚ùå Creating deep inheritance hierarchies
‚úÖ Use flatter, more explicit structures

### Context Fragmentation
‚ùå Spreading related code across many files
‚úÖ Keep related code together within context windows

### Implicit Dependencies
‚ùå Hiding dependencies in abstractions
‚úÖ Make dependencies explicit and self-contained

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**
   - Write for both humans and AI
   - Include context and purpose
   - Use clear, natural language

2. **Code Organization**
   - Keep related code together
   - Make boundaries explicit
   - Include necessary context

3. **Testing**
   - Write self-contained tests
   - Include test context
   - Make assertions clear
